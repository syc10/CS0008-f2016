This program asks for two things: distance driven and volume of gasoline used.
It asks the user for a preferred unit system (USC or metric) and asks for distance and volume based on that.
It then converts the given values to the unit system that was not selected.
Using the four values, the program calculates gas consumption (mpg and 1/100Km).
The program then compares the 1/100Km value to rank the gas consumption.
Finally, the program prints all relevant data.

At the start of the program, an input function was necessary to obtain information from the user.
Since all unit systems and their values are used in the end, I kept them consistent.
The variables Distance and Gas were always USC, and Distance_Metric and Gas_Metric were always metric.
After finding values for all 4 variables, they could be divided to find the consumption.
The metric consumption, or cm, was finally compared to the ratings.
Everything was printed and formatted.

Note: On github, the spacing for the output does not align well (the USC and Metric labels are too far ahead).
It also does not line up well in IDLE. However, it lined up in Pycharm.
