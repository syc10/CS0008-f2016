This program asks for two things: distance driven and volume of gasoline used.
It asks the user for a preferred unit system (USC or metric) and asks for distance and volume based on that.
It then converts the given values to the unit system that was not selected.
Using the four values, the program calculates gas consumption (mpg and 1/100Km).
The program then compares the 1/100Km value to rank the gas consumption.
Finally, the program prints all relevant data.
