This program opens multiple files. It counts the number of lines in the file and adds up the total.
The number of lines is stored as the partial total number of lines and the distance is stored as the partial distance.
After the user enters all the files needed, the program adds together all of the number of lines and distances and shows the toal for each.

At the start of the program, the program asks the user for the first file. It opens the file and adds up the appropriate numbers.
This is done in the processFile function. This function takes the file and adds up all of the lines and distances.
The function then returns the totals. The totals are displayed with the printKV function.
The printKV function is like a print function but it also provides formatting depending on the type of argument presented.
This function identifies and formats strings, ints, and floats. The appropriate formatting is applied.
After the user is finished with entering files, the program adds up all of the totals and displays them once again.
It uses the printKV file to print with consistent formatting.
